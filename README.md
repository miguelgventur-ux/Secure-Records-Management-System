## Security Features Implemented

### Required Features
| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Secure session cookies | `HttpOnly + SameSite=Strict` flags on every `Set-Cookie` |
| CSRF protection | Per-session token in every POST form, validated server-side before processing |
| SQL injection prevention | All queries use `database/sql` prepared statements with `?` placeholders |
| XSS prevention | All output rendered via `html/template`, which context-sensitively auto-escapes values |
| Password hashing | `bcrypt` at default cost (10 rounds); constant-time comparison via `CompareHashAndPassword` |
| Input validation | Length and regex checks on all user-supplied fields before DB writes |
| Audit trail | `last_updated_by` / `last_updated_at` columns updated atomically on every record write |
| Role-based access | Regular users: own record + low-risk fields only. Admins: full read/write on all records |

### Additional Feature 1 – Security Response Headers
Every HTTP response carries:
- **Content-Security-Policy**: `default-src 'self'` blocks inline scripts, external resources, and object embeds
- **X-Frame-Options: DENY** prevents clickjacking via iframe embedding  
- **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** stops MIME-type sniffing attacks  
- **Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin** limits referrer leakage to third parties

Applied via a `securityHeadersMiddleware` that wraps the entire router.

### Additional Feature 2 – Account Lockout (Brute-Force Protection)
- After **5 consecutive failed login attempts** the account is locked for **15 minutes**
- Lockout state (`failed_attempts`, `locked_until`) is stored in the database — survives server restarts and is enforced regardless of the attacker's IP address
- A **dummy bcrypt comparison** is performed on unknown usernames to equalise response time and defeat user-enumeration via timing side-channels
- Successful login resets the counter immediately
